Economic Development and Financial Markets
Theme
The impact of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment, GDP growth, and fiscal policies in the U.S. and Europe.

Research Questions
1.	How did unemployment rates in the U.S. and Europe change during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, and what were the recovery patterns?
This question investigates how unemployment rates were affected during these crises and the subsequent recovery periods. By focusing on labor market trends, we aim to identify differences in resilience, and the duration of unemployment spikes.
2.	How did GDP growth rates in the U.S. and Europe compare during and after the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic?
This question focuses on the impact of these crises on economic growth in the U.S. and Europe. The analysis seeks to reveal how these regions' economies contracted and recovered, providing insight into structural differences and the timing of economic refreshment.
3.	What was the relationship between government fiscal interventions (e.g., tax changes, government salary adjustments) and the speed of economic recovery in the U.S. and Europe during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic?
This question explores the role of fiscal policies in economic recovery. Examples include tax reductions to stimulate consumer spending, increased government salaries to boost demand, or salary cuts to manage public budgets during economic downturns. By comparing the U.S. and Europe, we aim to evaluate how these interventions influenced recovery speeds and economic stability.
